# ✅ When to Use an Array
    # 🔢 You have a fixed-size collection of similar data types.

    # 🧮 You need fast access to elements using an index (O(1) time).

    # 📋 You want to store items in a contiguous block of memory.

    # 📊 You're working with numerical data or matrices (e.g., in scientific computing).

    # 🛠️ You plan to perform lots of read operations and minimal insertions/deletions.

    # 🗂️ You need simple, ordered storage (e.g., list of names, scores, temperatures).

    # 📦 You know the maximum number of elements in advance.

# ❌ When Not to Use an Array
    # 📈 When the size of the data can change dynamically (use a list or linked list instead).

    # ➕ If you need to frequently insert/delete elements in the middle (inefficient in arrays).

    # 🕵️‍♂️ When you need fast searches (use a hash map or set instead).

    # 🧩 When the data is heterogeneous (different data types — use a dictionary or object).

    # 📉 When memory efficiency is important and the array is sparse (consider a sparse matrix or dict).

    # 🛣️ When you require flexible resizing without knowing the data size upfront.
